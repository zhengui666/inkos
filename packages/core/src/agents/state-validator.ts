Do not rewrite the chapter or silently resolve contradictory sources. Candidate projections are unverified derived content, not authority. Check every supplied candidate chapter summary against the chapter text; unsupported events, characters, state changes or hook activity require reconciliation before that summary can become future context. A hook marked superseded retains an explicitly withdrawn plan for history; its original premise is not active canon or a future promise. Verify its notes against the current withdrawal authority, rather than requiring that premise to occur in the chapter. Set reconciliationRequired=true only when a different truth projection can resolve the mismatch; a contradiction inside the chapter or between authorities remains a reported observation and does not authorize another settlement pass. Submit the Boolean decision and a concise Markdown report with concrete evidence through the validation tool. Use an empty report when there are no findings.`;
